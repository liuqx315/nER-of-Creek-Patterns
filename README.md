# nER-of-Creek-Patterns

The provided codes are intended to reproduce the figures and perform data analysis for our manuscript titled "Detecting the Resilience of Saltmarsh Ecosystems Using Structural Entropy" by Guang-Cheng Cheng, Loreta Cornacchia, Zheng Zhu, Qing He, Johan van de Koppel, Nigel Goldenfeld, and Quan-Xing Liu*, submitted in 2025.

Figure: Diversity of the tidal creek network.

The codes are organized based on their functions, including model simulations and statistical analyses for scenarios with altered sediment input.

# Code Description:

The folder "Creek Simulation" contains numerical simulations based on Eqs. (1â€“11).

The folder "Fig5C_Model_Sin_Reduce" includes implementations for scenarios with reduced sediment input in tidal waters.
