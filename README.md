The codes are classified by their function on model simulation, statistical analysis for changed sediment input. 

# Code:

The fold within "Creek Simulation" were implmented the numerical simulation on Eqs.(1-11);

The fold within "Fig5C_Model_Sin_Reduce" were implmented the changed seiment input on tidal water;
